This project focuses on implementing a deep learning model, specifically ResNet50, to perform object recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network architecture, will be employed to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images into their respective categories. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in image classification tasks.
